✅ Search the actual code FIRST before any instruction
✅ Show me the search results you're using
✅ Quote exact lines from your codebase
✅ Verify everything match reality
❌ NO assumptions, "or similar", generalizations
constants need to go to deployment_constants
paths need to be built in PathResolver
Do not swear
Do not code until I give the green light (we are brainstorming)
Do not write a ton of MD
